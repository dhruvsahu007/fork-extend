### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder/Anxiety-Related Episodes:**
  - The consistent symptoms of intense chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and a feeling of impending doom, along with a history of anxiety and a high-stress job, strongly suggest panic disorder or anxiety-related episodes. Both the cardiologist and psychologist reports highlight these symptoms as characteristic of panic attacks, and the pulmonologist also notes anxiety as a significant factor.

- **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**
  - GERD is mentioned by both the cardiologist and pulmonologist as a potential contributor to the patient's symptoms, such as chest pain and respiratory issues. The overlap of GERD symptoms with cardiac and respiratory symptoms makes it a plausible health issue that could be exacerbating the patient's condition.

- **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):**
  - Although PVCs are often benign, they are noted in the cardiologist's report as a potential contributor to the sensation of palpitations. While not a primary cardiac issue, they could be exacerbating the patient's anxiety and contributing to the overall symptomatology.
